// sbox_core_internal.h — the INTERNAL C ABI of the generic sandbox core.
//
// This is NOT the plugin ABI. Plugin authors include sbox.h; this header is
// compiled only INTO the single-image sbox.exe container (both personas link
// sbox_dll.cc statically), so the sbox_* symbols resolve at link time and stay
// out of the EXE's export table. It is **V8-agnostic** — it knows nothing about
// v8jsi, JavaScript, jitless, or any guest engine. One image uses it in two
// personas:
//   * the broker persona calls sbox_broker_* to spawn and lock down a worker,
//     and
//   * the worker persona calls sbox_target_* to run the sandboxed role and host
//     whatever the loaded plugin wants.
//
// Requires Windows 10 version 1809 (RS5, build 17763), Windows Server 2019,
// or later, for every mode. Broker and target must have the same architecture.
//
// Ordinary mode uses restricted tokens, a job, and integrity levels. Profile
// AppContainer/LPAC mode uses the Windows-created AppContainer token, its
// package/capabilities, a job, and integrity levels; it does not combine that
// identity with the ordinary mode's token-level or restricted-default-DACL
// settings. File rules are an additional broker-mediated access channel.
